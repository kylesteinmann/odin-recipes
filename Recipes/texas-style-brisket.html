       <li>Cracked Pepper</li>
       <li>Brisket Cut</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>In a small bowl or serving dish mix 1 part Kosher salt and 1 part cracked pepper. should be mixed ontil you have a even mixture.</li>
       <li>Prepare your meet by using paper towels dab all surfaces of your brisket dry.</li>
       <li>Genorously coat your brisket with the salt and paper mixture while pressing the seasoning into the meat as you go.</li>
       <li>Heat smoker until it is resting at 225 to 250 degrees farenheit</li>
       <li>Insert brisket into the smoker and close.</li>
       <li>When the internal temperature reaches 165 to 170, wrap your brisket in aluminum foil so that it does not leak the juices as it finishes cooking. At this point the smoking portion of the portion is complete.</li>
       <li>While it is wrapped, let it continue to cook until internal temperature reaches 205 degrees farenheit.</li>
       <li>At 205 degrees farenheit, the fat will be fully renedered and ready to remove from the smoker.</li>
       <li>This next step is important!!! Leave the brasket wrapped in aluminum foil. Wrap it in a towel and place it in a cooler or in a inclosed tight space like a microwave. The goal is to let the meat cool slowly so that it can pull alot of the juices back into the meat, giving it the ultamate tenderness and juiciness.</li>
       <li>Once it has rested 2 to 3 hours (about an hour for every 4 pounds of meat) it is ready to serve. Slice it with the grain for the best results.</li>
