   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Who does not love a juicy smoked pulled pork sandwich. It would be a crime against humanity to openly admit otherwise.</p>
   <p>The pork butt is one of most covetted and versitile BBQ specials. Let's see if we can make the best.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Pork Butt (a.k.a Pork Shoulder)</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>In a small bowl or serving dish mix 1 part Kosher salt, 1 part cracked pepper, 1 part ceyanne pepper, 1 part paprika and 3 parts brown sugar.This should be mixed until you have a even mixture.</li>
       <li>Prepare your meat by using paper towels to dab all surfaces of your pork butt dry.</li>
       <li>Genorously coat your pork butt with the seasoning mixture while pressing the seasoning into the meat as you go.</li>
       <li>Heat smoker until it is resting at 225 to 250 degrees farenheit</li>
       <li>Insert the pork butt into the smoker and close.</li>
       <li>When the internal temperature reaches 165 to 170, wrap your pork butt in aluminum foil so that it does not leak the juices as it finishes cooking. At this point the smoking portion of the portion is complete.</li>
       <li>While it is wrapped, let it continue to cook until internal temperature reaches 205 degrees farenheit.</li>
       <li>At 205 degrees farenheit, the fat will be fully renedered and ready to remove from the smoker.</li>
       <li>This next step is important!!! Leave the Pork butt wrapped in aluminum foil. Wrap it in a towel and place it in a cooler or in a inclosed tight space like a microwave. The goal is to let the meat cool slowly so that it can pull alot of the juices back into the meat, giving it the ultamate tenderness and juiciness.</li>
       <li>Once it has rested 2 to 3 hours (about an hour for every 4 pounds of meat) it is ready to serve.</li>
   </ol>
